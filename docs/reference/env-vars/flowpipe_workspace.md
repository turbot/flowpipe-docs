# FLOWPIPE_WORKSPACE

Sets the Flowpipe [workspace](/docs/reference/config-files/workspace). 

A Flowpipe `workspace` is a "profile" that allows you to define a unified environment that the Flowpipe can interact with.

## Usage 
Use the `my_workspace` workspace:
```bash
export FLOWPIPE_WORKSPACE=my_workspace
```

<!--
FUTURE:

```bash
export FLOWPIPE_WORKSPACE=acme/prod
```
