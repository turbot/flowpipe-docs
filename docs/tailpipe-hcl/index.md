# Tailpipe HCL

You use Powerpipe to run Tailpipe mods written with a combination of HCL (to configure visualizations) and SQL (to flow data into visualizations). Tailpipe doesn't invent new HCL constructs, instead it leverages [Powerpipe HCL](https://powerpipe.io/docs/powerpipe-hcl). 

As an author of Tailpipe mods, you will likely be most interested in writing detections using [detection](tbd), [detection_benchmark](tbd), and [query](tbd). But your mods can also include [dashboards](https://powerpipe.io/docs/powerpipe-hcl/dashboard) with [charts, tables, infocards, and more](https://powerpipe.io/docs/powerpipe-hcl/dashboard#argument-reference). They can even include [benchmarks](https://powerpipe.io/docs/powerpipe-hcl/benchmark) and [controls](https://powerpipe.io/docs/powerpipe-hcl/controls).
