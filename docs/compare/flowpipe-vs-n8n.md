# About Flowpipe

Flowpipe is workflow for DevOps. Use it to automate cloud operations, coordinate people and pipelines, and build workflows as code.

**Use prebuilt workflows**. The <a href="https://hub.flowpipe.io/" target="_blank">Flowpipe Hub</a> provides ready-to-run pipelines for common DevOps scenarios.

**Build custom workflows**. Pipelines are <a href="https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/mod-dependencies" target="_blank">composable</a>. Extend the prebuilt workflows, or build your own from scratch. Any pipeline can call, or be called by, any other.

  
**Leverage diverse step types**. A step can <a href="https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/step/http" target="_blank">make an HTTP call</a>, <a href="https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/step/input" target="_blank">gather human input</a>, <a href="https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/step/message" target="_blank">send a message</a>, <a href="https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/step/query" target="_blank">run a query</a>, <a href="https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/step/pipeline" target="_blank">run a pipeline</a>, <a href="https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/step/container" target="_blank">use a container</a>, or run a <a href="https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/step/function" target="_blank">run a lambda function</a>. 

**React to events**. A <a href="https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/trigger" target="_blank">trigger</a> runs a pipeline when an event occurs, via a <a href="https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/trigger/http" target="_blank">webhook</a>, <a href="https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/trigger/query" target="_blank">query</a>, or <a href="https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/trigger/schedule" target="_blank">schedule</a>.

**Use code, not clicks**. Pipelines are <a href="https://flowpipe.io/docs/build" target="_blank">HCL</a>: version-controlled, shareable, easy to edit â€” designed for the way you work.

**Deploy anywhere**. Use it locally, or deploy it in CI/CD pipelines.
