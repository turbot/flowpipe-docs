## When to choose Flowpipe over AWS Step Functions
AWS Step Functions provides a managed way to coordinate components in AWS-centric distributed applications.

Flowpipe is the preferred choice for DevOps engineers who automate cloud operations, coordinate people and pipelines, and build workflows as code.

## About Flowpipe
Flowpipe is workflow for DevOps. Use it to automate cloud operations, coordinate people and pipelines, and build workflows as code.

Use prebuilt workflows. The [Flowpipe Hub](https://hub.flowpipe.io/) provides ready-to-run pipelines for common DevOps scenarios.

Build custom workflows. Pipelines are [composable](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/mod-dependencies). Extend the prebuilt workflows, or build your own from scratch. Any pipeline can call, or be called by, any other.

Leverage diverse step types. A step can [make an HTTP call](https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/step/http), [gather human input](https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/step/input), [send a message](https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/step/message), [run a query](https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/step/query), [run a pipeline](https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/step/pipeline), [use a container](https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/step/container), or [run a lambda function](https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/step/function).

React to events. A [trigger](https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/trigger) runs a pipeline when an event occurs, via a [webhook](https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/trigger/http), [query](https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/trigger/query), or [schedule](https://flowpipe.io/docs/flowpipe-hcl/trigger/schedule).

Use code, not clicks. Pipelines are [HCL](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build): version-controlled, shareable, easy to edit â€” designed for the way you work.

Deploy anywhere. Use it locally, or deploy it in CI/CD pipelines.
